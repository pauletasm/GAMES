Blocity is a game developed by me on Unity and coded on C++, 
this game was insipred by a large group of similar games available on smartphones where a ball is controlled by the player. 
The concept of the game is to controll the ball in order do dodge the obstacles.
We can move:
Right
Left
Up - to give the ball more speed
Down - to slow it down until a certain speed 
It was my first game but I think it turned out pretty cool!
